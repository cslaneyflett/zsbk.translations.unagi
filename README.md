## Unified English translations for UNAGI's apparel mods.

Translate UNAGI's apparel mods from Japanese to English, and unify existing English text, along with fixes for mistakes in existing English text.

Descriptions are also unified to be a bit more clear on the behavior / purpose of apparel.

This also removes the 'UNA ' and 'UNA_' prefixes from items already in English, to attempt to make the clothes look more vanilla and unified with the base game content.

### Extra info
